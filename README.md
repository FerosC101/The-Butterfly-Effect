# GLOM – Butterfly Effect World Simulation

## Overview

**GLOM** is a data-driven simulation game where small changes lead to massive, unpredictable outcomes.
Players tweak a single data point in a fully simulated world and watch as the effects ripple across decades of economic, environmental, political, and cultural change.
It blends chaos theory with strategy and humor, creating a unique experience that is both entertaining and thought-provoking.

## Core Features

* **Procedurally Generated Worlds**
  Every playthrough starts with a unique geography, economy, climate, and cultural landscape.

* **Small Tweaks, Big Impact**
  Adjust rainfall, alter tax rates, seed cultural trends, or tweak internet speeds — then watch the consequences unfold.

* **Simulation-Driven Gameplay**
  Uses agent-based modeling, probabilistic events, and interlinked datasets to generate realistic cause-and-effect scenarios.

* **Multiple Game Modes**

  * Objective Mode: Achieve absurdly specific goals.
  * Chaos Mode: Unlimited experimentation.
  * Multiplayer Sabotage: Influence or disrupt worlds with other players.
  * Twitch Integration: Viewers vote on real-time changes.

* **Interactive Data Visualization**
  Live dashboards, heatmaps, charts, and animated vignettes that show your world’s transformation.

## How It Works

1. **World Generation**
   The game creates a dynamic world with hundreds of interconnected stats.

2. **Data Manipulation**
   Spend your Data Influence Budget (DIB) each turn to tweak a variable.

3. **Simulation**
   The AI fast-forwards time, applying your changes and creating ripple effects.

4. **Results and Events**
   Watch changes manifest through metrics, visual animations, and unexpected story events.
